Micro blogging project
______________________________________________________________________________________

Summary

Create a fully functional micro blogging web app (like twitter) in 5 stages


Technical Notes

The design is provided through figma, please follow the design provided (making it responsive is a bonus)
Make meaningful commits (they should be small and with feature/bug specification), and push them to the repo.
You will get code reviews on your github repo.
Keep an organized folder structure - components in “components” folder, pages in another folder and reusable code in lib folder.

Milestone 1 - Mock up

Figma design (first line of screens): https://www.figma.com/file/KQsukwnsiYo01g7Id1m11Q/ITC-Micro-blogging-Project?node-id=0%3A1

Features:
Main screen with two parts: create tweet, and tweets list
Create tweet should block the tweet creation if there are more than 140 chars (need to make the button disabled)
The tweets should be saved locally, so if I refresh the page they won’t be deleted
the tweet list should be sorted in descending order, the latest tweet should appear first  (the order should remain after refreshing the page)
The username should be saved hard-coded for now (so you will be able to add it to each tweet you create) 




Milestone 2 - Server connection

Features:
Move the local app data (for keeping the data between each refresh),  to a server: https://fullstack-web-course.ew.r.appspot.com/
The server has one resource exposed: “/tweet”, make requests to presenting the list of tweets, and to create a new tweet
The tweet object is as follows: { content: string, userName: string, date: string (ISO date) }
Save the tweet to the server on tweet post, and show the list of tweets from the server
Show loading indicator, and prevent from adding a new tweet when adding request is in the background
Do not forget to remove the code from the first milestone that saves the data locally, you don’t want to have them both
Display server errors to the user if the tweet is not added

Milestone 3 - User page

Features:
Add another page that presents the current user username (which should be hard coded until now), and has a form to change the username.
You should save the new username locally whenever changed, and send it to the server when creating a new tweet.
Add a navbar to the top of the screen that keeps its position no matter which page you are at, with “Home” and “Profile” links.
The design is in the second line of screen in figma: https://www.figma.com/file/KQsukwnsiYo01g7Id1m11Q/ITC-Micro-blogging-Project?node-id=0%3A1

Milestone 4  - Context

Features:
Instead of using state and props, use context for the tweets list and creating new tweet
When creating new tweet, do not refresh the list, but add the tweet to the existing local list
Instead set an interval that gets updates from the server of tweets, in case someone else added a tweet (to keep the list updated)


Milestone 5 - Deployment

Features:
Add deployment to firebase so your app will be available from a remote server
Create a new firebase project (no need to add credit card)
Follow this guide: https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-deploy-a-react-app-with-firebase-hosting-98063c5bf425
If you have trouble deploying, look for other solutions online for how to deploy a react app to firebase.

Milestone 6 - Firebase

Replace the server connection with firebase firestore
Send data and get data from firestore (you can use the account you created for deployment)
Only logged in users can see tweets and send tweets (see “firestore rules”) - implement a Login and Sign Up page with firebase auth, if the user is not logged in to prevent routing to the tweets pages, and redirect the user to the login page. You can implement your own view and design. Implement a login and signup both with google and with a custom username and password.
Instead of saving the userName on every tweet, save a reference to the user  by the user id.
Add profile picture upload for every user (hint: use firebase cloud storage)
The data needs to update live when there are new tweets (without intervals)
Implement infinite scrolling - at the beginning get 10 tweets, and when the user reaches the end of the screen load the next 10 tweets, etc. (hint: look for firestore pagination.)
No need for a custom backend! all of your code should be in your react project.


Milestone 7 - Your tweets
 
Implement a feature that allows the user to display only their own tweets
The feature should have at least the following:
a clickable element that changes css class based on whether selected or not 
the clickable element should change text based on whether it is selected; when selected, it will show the text "All Tweets", meaning that if you click on it, it will show all tweets; when not selected, it will show the text "My Tweets", meaning that if you click on it, it will show just your tweets
Upon clicking the clickable element, the page should show the corresponding tweets; hint: use state/props and life cycle methods to control which tweets are displayed
Add one more css class based change to the page upon this event happening; for instance, maybe the page background has a different color when viewing your own tweets when compared to viewing all tweets

Milestone 8 - Navbar 

Change your Navbar so that it responds based on whether the user is signed in 
When the user is not signed in, the Navbar links should display “Signup” and “Login” links.
When the user is signed in, the Navbar should display “Logout” and also have a search bar.
The search bar should allow users to search the tweets and user; include a button or some way for the user to toggle between searching for tweets and for users
Searching using the navbar should result in the list of tweets displaying only the tweets that match the search criteria

Milestone 9 - Like button part 1

Add a like button to every tweet
When a user clicks the like button, the button should change its appearance to indicate to the user that they “liked” that tweet; if a user has not clicked on the button, the button should indicate that the user has not “liked” it
After a user “likes” a tweet, they should be able to “unlike” it
Apply your own styling and text to this button
Apply an animation that happens when the user clicks the like button

Milestone 10 - Like button part 2

Use firebase to keep track of which users have “liked” which tweets
When saving “likes” in firebase, be sure to associate the like with the liking user’s id  instead of their userName or other identification
Add a button to the Navbar so that when the user is signed in for signed-in users
Clicking the button should change the list of tweets to show only the tweets that this user has liked
When the user clicks the button again, the list of tweets should display all tweets
Apply your own styling and text to this button


Milestone 11 - Other users profiles
 
In the display for each tweet, turn the userName into a link
When a user clicks the userName link on a tweet, your application should take the user to a page that displays the profile for the user who wrote the tweet
The design for this page should be similar in design for the page you made for the User Page
Add a “home” or “back” button to your Navbar so that the user can easily return to the list of tweets

Milestone 12 - More firebase
 
A user should be able to edit their own profile
When a user is logged in and visits their User Page (the one from Milestone 3, not Milestone 11), they should be able to edit and save the following in firebase:
photo
name
password
Be sure that when a user edits their photo or name, their tweets change too such that they display the updated photo and name

Milestone 13 - Followers
 
Think about what details this feature would need; visit social media platforms that you like and see how they implemented their follow feature
Implement a way for users to follow one another
Build this feature out as far as you can
